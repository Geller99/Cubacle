      'With our new incredible artist and story writing partners Adel and noitom studios, we will have a high level professional story created and told physically through a comic book. Itâ€™s extremely important that CubeX as a brand builds itself out in many forms and this includes physical products. Creating a comic book adds depth to our company and shows we are not just a company with virtual assets, but also great physical assets. The goal is to build out our brand and ip while expanding on the story behind the Cubies and give our holders a first look at how the Cubies society lives and operates. We will be introducing some key characters in the Cubie world and society(could be your NFT). Now our holders and the NFT space will start to see that we are not just random NFTs that were created with no purpose. There is a deep rooted story behind the Cubie society and now through physical products we can bring it to life. This comic book will open up the window for many of our stories to be told and may or may not lead to many more connected to our partners. The comic book is a Q2 item and expected to launch early summer for holders through the soft staking program to have access to the physical copies.',

    <p>     We are pleased to announce that we will be hosting massive gaming events through BFC powered by CubeX in 2023. What is BFC? BFC is a tournaments and events organizing company which aims to host innovative gaming events that reach millions of gamers across the world. BFC has hosted hundreds of thousands of dollars in tournaments with massive game titles such as Fornite, Apex Legends, Valorant, and Rocket League. We have pioneered the way traditional gaming tournaments have been hosted. Through our marketing and hosting methods BFC has achieved incredible ROI and growth. To put everything into perspective, context must be added to truly understand how we are miles ahead of our competitors, even if they have hundreds of millions of dollars. To do this, we will explain the traditional tournament model, how BFC redefined the traditional model to become the most efficient tournament organizers in all of esports and gaming. To prove our points, we will focus on the ROI from a viewer to dollar ratio, providing raw data and evidence to prove the above statements.</p>

    <p>
    Founding our company in 2019, with minimal funding, we understood we needed to utilize our experience and produce something unique to the point where we are innovating and pioneering the entire industry. We understood that the way tournaments are promoted through big corporative publishers who own their own game, is extremely large prize pools which attract millions of pro players and fans all across the globe. For example, Epic Games hosted the biggest tournament in all of esports called the Fortnite "World Cup" in a stadium in NY for a whopping $30,000,000.00, the most in esports history! Just as a side note, CubeX, previously known as Kungarna, had the most players competing in this event winning over $1M! By investing $30M Dollars, Epic Games created monumental history with 2.3M viewers across the globe according to esports insider. This would yield a viewer to dollar value of 0.076. The Overwatch League Finals hosted by Blizzard (company valued at ~58B dollars) Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY where the Nets play estimated 1.55M in viewership with a prize pool of 3.5M dollars yielding a 0.428 viewer to dollar value. These are one-off events as well, so it happens for just one day, and then it's all over.

    </p>

    <p>

    The BFC has a model that we see as more valuable, being a consistent series that happens throughout a season, kind of like a league with multiple weeks. Comparing our efficiency, ROI, and data with other publishers, the statistics are stunning. For one of our Fortnite tournaments, which was a $5,000 prize pool, we generated 104,000 live concurrent viewers watching our event giving us a whopping 20.4 viewer to dollar ratio. These numbers are completely insane, because the truth is, you can't buy raw authenticity, and organic gaming community support. Our model is highly innovative and revolutionary in the industry with an expert team utilizing their experience and network to capitalize on a rapidly growing industry.
    Why is this good for CubeX? We will now be able to utilize our gaming tournament platforms and connections to broadcast CubeX and Web3 educational content throughout the traditional gaming space to millions of gamers. What's great specifically about our Fortnite events is that we control our own gaming arena and can custom build it to add in advertisement space. We will utilize these spaces to promote whatever we desire, such as CubeX, NFTs, Web3, partnerships, sponsorships, and more. The power is in our hands and we will do our very best to spread awareness about our incredible company/project. We plan to give CubeX holders exclusive access to these events and opportunities to even compete and meet the biggest gaming stars.

      We're pleased to announce that CubeX will officially be launching its own animated series. @AdelBarry is an expert in the field of Hollywood, animation, and mocap. He will be leading the charge in our all NEW CubeX studio in Los Angeles. Through @CubeX Doug and his amazing connections we have officially licensed a top of the line studio capable of producing content at a similar level to Disney. We are building the future of independent video production to create Hollywood 3.0! CubeX will use its exclusive and innovative technological capabilities and strategic relationships to create a interactive and dynamic Animated Series using Motion Capture Technology and UnrealEngine5! We will use our Motion Capture suits to move Cubie characters in our 3D CubeX Environments to create amazing stories and situations that no one has seen before. Smooth motion, highly realistic movement, and emotion show from the face. Using UnrealEngine we have will create highly polished BoxOffice quality content at a rapid pace and fractional budget! Light reflecting surfaces, realistic lighting, real physics all brought together to compete with Disney! We have the experience, we have the technology, we have the community which all 3 are needed for success! The long term goal is to build a wildly successful brand that is adored and loved by millions of content consumers. Doing a 10 minute search on YouTube you can find hundreds of popular animated series and brands that received tens of millions of views a month through their entertaining series. These brands have amassed millions of followers and several revenue streams that generate a lucrative income. If we can create a brand on a similar level, then that would add immense value to our our company, but also to our NFTs and holders. You own your NFTs IP and rights to build your own brand out of it. BAYC is an incredible example of holders using their IP rights to create successful brands, companies, and identities. We want our brand to thrive on many levels which includes gaming, web3, hollywood, IRL events, and many more. This is just one more step into the right direction for our company.

    CubeX has deep gaming roots and establishing ourselves as a premier gaming company in web3 is one of our priorities. Not only are we a brand that creates gaming content, but also a company that builds and develops games. We have already launched 3 fully operating video games on our gaming website <a href="https://cubexgaming.com/games/" > https://cubexgaming.com/games/ </a> here you can find Splat, Swarm, and Survivor. With all three of our games being blockchain integrated and web3 friendly, we are slowly making a name for our selves in the game building industry. By the end of 2023 we hope to have several more games under our library, including games built by other web3 companies and projects.
    </p>
    
    One of these games is going to be created and developed by our community. We are giving our holders the power and control to build a video game with us. We will do this through our Cubicle voting system which allows every NFT to cast an anonymous vote that will dictate the direction of our video game. Do you want it on mobile? Vote yes. Do you want a strategy game? Do you want a racing game? The options will be limitless and our holders will decide the fate of this video game. Building video games allows our company to expand our assets and revenue potential. It's important we diversify what we're creating under the CubeX brand to attract as many new holders, investments, and partnerships.
    <p>  
    This game is planned to launch in 2023. More information will come soon!

      CubeX is ready to establish itself as a premier gaming brand in 2023. We have some of the best and most popular gamers in the world representing our CubeX and with that comes new lucrative opportunities. In 2023 we will be officially launching our own store which will sell gaming gear items such as mousepads, chairs, headsets, and more. As mentioned several times before, it's extremely important to generate multiple revenue streams outside of just selling NFTs. The reason we chose this venture is because we have millions of gaming followers and our gaming ambassadors have millions of gaming followers. What better than to cater a store around the gaming industry? We will utilize our massive gamers and essentially make them our "stamp of approval" for the CubeX gaming gear. For example, if your child is in to basketball and they want to improve their game, then they are very likely going to ask you to buy a pair of Lebron James or Steph Curry shoes. A gamer will do the exact same thing, but instead of shoes they will ask for the same mouse or headset that their favorite gamer uses. We will weaponize our gamers to sell our products thus creating an all new revenue generating stream for CubeX. We want our company to be one of the only profitable "NFT projects" in the entire space. This is just another took in our tool kit.

We always want to be a force of good in the universe, the real world. Being quarantined here with Covid has not been a good feeling at all, but it makes you think about others in the hospital who are battling cancer and other diseases. We would like to purchase some VR headsets and visit sick children who are battling every single day who cannot go to a carnival, and we want them to be with us enjoying all the games and rides alongside the Cubies! This event will help raise charity for children who are sick and we are bringing NFTers all around the world around a cause worth fighting for!

Throughout our entire esteemed Roadmap2.0, we have been inclusive to the entire CubeX community, organizing events that all CUBIES can join in! For this roadmap item, we wanted to pay homage to our biggest whales with the CubeX House Party!

This is very dear and special for us, to meet our biggest whales face to face, and a memory that will be cherished forever! This trip will come with never before seen exclusive access, free items, and so mucn more!

Before our career in NFTs, we have amassed hundreds of millions of views creating content and we have a channel currently with over 639,000 subscribers which we will revamp to the official CubeX podcast. We will be hosting this at the CubeX House, hence the reason we put a gold microphone in the backyard of the CubeX House in the Roadmap picture, but why a gold microphone?
    </p>

    <p>
      Gold represents immense value, and not only are we taking an active role in bridging the gap between web2 and web3 as leaders in both industries, we will be giving away things of value every single week! These valuables can either be an NFT of value, ETH airdropped into your wallet, a shoutout on the podcast where you can be featured and join us in talking to our viewers and the CubeX team, physical items, and so much more!
    </p>

    <p>
      Special technology: As many of you may know, we have brought on experts to our team to help lead us in an innovative direction with motion capture MOCAP technologies, which includes training and cutting edge technology assets we can add to our repertoire. Imagine the first ever animated podcast bringing NFTs to life visually!
      What would a conversation look like between a gaming ambassador who has earned $500,000 in gaming and a BAYC whale who's earned $500,000 flipping NFTs in the same room alongside TFG and Moe? These are the thought-provoking intriguing fruitful conversations we are looking to spark and truly bridge the gap with our vast connections and network!

      Finally we have seen a massive spark in short content invigorating the content algorithm among YouTube shorts and Tiktok, mainly being short clips of podcasts. As community leaders, we are always asked by community members how they can do more, and here is an opportunity where we can repost clips all across social media and raise awareness and views about all of the special things we are doing. This will help us in many ways and expand our content production through our community, one of the members who will be doing this is Showtimekaz who has amassed millions of likes on tiktok and hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform. Together we stand, divided we fall, we are looking to do over 50 episodes in 2023! Stay tuned

    <p>
      As many of you know HUBBL is the future of NFT/WEB3 socialization. We have been developing a brand new app which will make NFT users lives much easier. Hubbl is a LONG TERM plan and expected to be ready in 2023. So many companies make billions building products that solve problems for consumers, makes their lives easier, and saves them time. We will finally have one place where we can do almost everything Discord, Twitter, Raritytools, nft trackers, wallet trackers, project pages, hot drops, upcoming drops, top projects, and so many more platforms can do. I definitely believe in the long term technology we are building here. Again to reiterate this isn't a week, month, or even one year plan. We are thinking 5-10 years down the line.
    </p>

    <p>
      We launched our first beta phase for HUBBL in November. This one week period allowed our holders to use the app and find any and all bugs. It was a successful launch and ever since we've been working on all changes needed to improve the app for the best user experience possible. It takes a lot of time to develop a high level functioning social media app with so many tools and features. We have secured some huge partnerships and are working on a few more. Our first partnership is with popular NFT rarity tool company "RaritySniffer", which allows every HUBBL user to sift through thousands of projects and their rarity rankings inside our app. There is so much data involved when working with the Rarity Sniffer API and transmitting it between the two apps. Features like this take months to perfect and it is one of our top priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once HUBBL is ready to launch publicly we will begin our full marketing plan which will revolve on NFT call to action events. For example, I've done many giveaways for hyped project WL spots that have reached well over 100,000 active NFT users on Twitter. I will utilize my Twitter and brand to incentivize these top upcoming projects to partner with HUBBL and allocate hundreds of WL spots on our platform. In order for Twitter users to enter, they will need to join HUBBL. Once they join HUBBL, we will have full control of what is promoted and what they will see. Prioritizing CubeX on HUBBL will allow our project to receive incredible exposure. This is one of our many marketing strategies that we will deploy.

    Why are we focusing so heavily on our metaverse in Roadmap2.0?
    </p>

    <p>
    From the words of TFG at 00:00:49s of the recorded podium, "We are trying to have the most influential and biggest metaverse ever..." We believe that our metaverse is a proof of concept with established fundamentals that will develop and evolve with greater engine technology, but for now, we are looking to bring our CubeX community and other web3 communities together! There is no geographical location limitation, and we are opening up a whole new platform of interaction both visually and auditory channeling a revolutionary way of communicating with your NFTs. We want to give you all the ultimate control of player avatar, player connection, and player experience. Player avatar is accessed through your CubeX NFTs on the blockchain, player connection is the platform of Cubeverse made up communicating and socializing with community members all over the globe, and player experience is every single interaction between you and Cubeverse. Hence, this is why as leaders of CubeX Society, there is a massive emphasis on generating activity in Cubeverse, from various avenues of events, special quests, and featurization we have built in our amazing metaverse! We are shaping the future of NFT utilization through innovative metaverse adoption. Is there a Web2 aspect for CubeX Racing Endeavours"

    We are going to be attempting to partner up with a professional racecar driver whether its NASCAR or FORMULA ONE. TFG also explains that there is a massive international opportunity to attach our CubeX IP / Branding alongside professional racing in Japan via a connection from one of our biggest whales who currently resides there. Racing is a huge form of entertainment in Japan and there is a history of racing culture situated all across the region.

      </p>

      <p>
      In 2022, we have explored various methods in order to create real value for NFTs and the mechanism we embraced was "staking", a concept that would serve as an NFT vault which was still a very new concept in the NFT space. As a team, we collected loads of analysis and data to truly understand the pros and cons of a staking program, how can we improve quality of life, how can we improve user interface, how can we evolve and determine the next phase of NFT evolution?
      </p>
      <p>
      In essence, the question we always asked is how can we reward our holders with never seen before utility organized in a centralized HQ base with data tracking, and how can we further reward the holders who have been holding longer than others supporting this project early?
      </p>
      <p>
      We believe that this concept we are building on will not only innovate how rewards are distributed, but will completely revolutionize the system of NFT interaction between team and holder.

      Claims: As you progress on your journey with us, you will now be eligible to claim more rewards as a holder and member of CubeX! This is where you claim all rewards you are eligible for by holding the CubeX NFT and not listing. The longer you hold, the greater the progression buildup, the more valuable the reward may be. This is where you can also claim prizes from exclusive events, for example, lets say you are the winner of the 20ETH CubeX Grand Race, and you get 1st place and are eligible for 10ETH. You can claim your 10ETH here and in a single fast transaction, the 10ETH will be airdropped to your wallet! This will be a very fun tab

Every Cubie is important to us and it is important we built a utility within the dashboard because actions speak louder than words, and every community member will have a responsibility and moral obligation to help us make big decisions in the future!

    CubeX has done an amazing job building out its brand, video games, metaverse and platforms for our holders. With being a holder you own a dynamic full body 3d piece of art that can serve as your online virtual identity in Cubeverse, video games, and on social media. With that being said, we have noticed that our 3d models donâ€™t serve as great PFP identities. PFP identities are almost an essential when it comes to building a successful long term NFT project. Some projects alone have succeeded at a high level for just having great PFP identity. Due to this we have decided it would be a shame if we didnâ€™t develop a 2D PFP collection of Cubies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now itâ€™s important to understand our mission. We are setting out to create one of the most appealing PFP art collections of all time. We have hired one of the most talented 2D artists in all of web3. Over the last 2 months our artist has already been creating various prototypes and concepts for what this collection could look like. NOTHING is set in stone and the reason we are announcing this roadmap item so early is because we want to utilize our community as a tool to be a part of this process and help us develop the best PFP collection in NFT history.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will empower our holders using our <a href="HoldAndEarn.com">HoldAndEarn.com</a> dashboard through the cubicle voting system. We will host several votes on different prototypes, traits, and ideas. We will also be reading through any and all suggestions regarding the direction of this PFP collection. It is imperative that we take our time and execute at the highest level on this collection. We will only be able to create it once.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our team has also taken the initiative of reaching out to huge art collectors and trait collectors in the web3 space. Individuals who whale on NFTs based on their art. We are piling up as much data as we can on what makes collections desirable and addictive to collect. Information is king and we believe with the right people, research, community, and artists that we can build the best collection.
    </p>
    <p>    Through the <a href="HoldAndEarn.com">HoldAndEarn.com</a> dashboard CubeX 3d NFTs will allow you the access to this next collection. Be sure to listen to the podium below for more details on this roadmap item!
